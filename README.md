**Designing Software**

**How do I approach designing software?**

I approach software design by first breaking the problem into smaller, manageable components and defining clear responsibilities for each part of the system. For this project, I separated concerns such as scene management, camera control, lighting, and object creation, which helped keep the code organized and maintainable.

**What new design skills did this project help me develop?**

This project strengthened my ability to design modular systems for graphics applications. I learned to structure reusable functions for transformations, lighting configuration, and object generation, thereby making the scene easier to expand and debug.

**What design process did I follow?**

I followed an iterative design process that started with basic geometry and camera movement, then gradually added textures, lighting, and interaction. Each milestone built on the previous one, allowing me to test functionality incrementally and refine the scene over time.

**How can this design approach be applied in future work?**

This modular, incremental design approach can be applied to larger software systems, game engines, and simulations by improving scalability, readability, and long-term maintainability.

**Developing Programs**

**How do I approach developing programs?**

I develop programs incrementally, focusing first on core functionality and then layering in additional features. I prioritize frequent testing and code refactoring as complexity increases.

**What new development strategies did I use?**

While working on this 3D scene, I used structured debugging, shader uniform management, and modular function development. I also gained experience integrating external libraries such as GLM and STB Image into a larger application.

**How did iteration factor into development?**

Iteration was essential. Each milestone allowed me to revise camera controls, lighting behavior, and scene layout based on testing results. Minor improvements were repeated, leading to a stable and polished final project.

**How has my development approach evolved?**

Over the course of the milestones, my code became more organized, modular, and readable. I moved away from monolithic functions toward cleaner abstractions, which directly contributed to the successful completion of the final project.

**Computer Science and My Goals**

**How can computer science help me reach my goals?**

Computer science provides me with problem-solving skills, technical foundations, and the ability to build real-world applications. Courses such as CS 330 broaden my understanding beyond traditional software to include visual and interactive systems.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations support my educational pathway?**

This project deepened my understanding of linear algebra, transformations, camera systems, and rendering pipelines, all of which are valuable for advanced coursework in graphics, simulation, and visualization.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations support my professional pathway?**

The skills developed in this course are directly applicable to careers in game development, simulation software, virtual reality, and data visualization. Understanding how to build and navigate a 3D environment demonstrates both technical depth and creative problem-solving ability.
